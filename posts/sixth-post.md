As typical as it is, this was my first dynamic deployed full stack application. What is unique about it though is that one can create their own URL by simply adding any name they want the list to be. Before I knew how to implement authentication and authorization and create user specific pages, this was my solution to create any amount of lists necessary.

Before this site, I made a static Tic Tac Toe project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and deployed it.
