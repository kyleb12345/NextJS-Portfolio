This is the largest single page static website I have built aside from my Tic Tac Toe project. 

The website has all of my hosted projects, their deployed links, and the links to GitHub. Check this site out to see an awesome parallax scroll, cloud animation, panels, and be sure to check the website out at different media sizes.
