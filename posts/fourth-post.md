Originally I began this project with React and used Firebase as the backend. I then migrated the project to NextJS and MongoDB. This is the first NextJS project that I deployed and made to completion. The first version was a ReactJS meetup site around the world, but since I upgraded it, what's 'next?' Space meetups.

My project after this one? The blog portfolio site you're on right now.
