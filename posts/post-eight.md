Thanks for checking out this portfolio site. My name is Kyle and I am just beginning my web development and programming journey.

I began with a Google Data Analyst certification course, through that I learned the ins and outs of being a data analyst and what skills and tools they use. In doing all of it I enjoyed learning MySQL and this led me down the path to learning about other database systems and then how websites use them. Thus the plunge into web development began, from my first static website, tic-tac-toe, to this portfolio site you're on now created with NextJS, Node, Express, and MongoDB. 

What technologies have I learned so far? MySQL, MongoDB, Firebase, Excel, Tableau, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, EJS, React, NextJS, NodeJS, Express, and various APIs. 

Before, I was a teacher. I taught AP Human Geography, on-level Geography and Leadership. I was Department Chair for Social Studies at my school and was the content lead over my subject for the district. As schools transitioned through multiple waves of Covid I led other Geography teachers through it, adjusting how school was done- virtual, hybrid, and in-person with covid. Both before and after covid transitions other teachers used my lesson plans that I developed for the district that I taught to them. Through that I have taught over a dozen teachers and thousands of students geography in Texas throughout the years.

Before teaching in Texas I lived in China for a while. I taught English and American History at Xiamen No. 1 High School, and attended Xiamen University to expand my Chinese language skills.

I have a bachelors degree in International Development and minors in Business and Chinese from the University of North Texas.
