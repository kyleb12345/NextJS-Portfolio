This is my second largest project and is an online shop to sell plants. Due to the recent winter freeze, well, I can't say I have much to display anymore... Enjoy the tomatoes?

Nonetheless, each item I add to the site is connected to the stripe API (the test version as its not a 'real' online shop, though it could be...). I made myself administrative functions and users are able to create accounts, log in, add products to their cart, and check out. It will also show whether an order is on the way or sent as managed from the administrative account to toggle those just as a real business would.

Sessions are stored on the user's browser, passwords are encrypted and hashed. All site data is stored on MongoDB.

Watch the GIF to see how the full project works as I switch from admin user to a regular shopper. This was my first larger full stack project. Before this I created the Tic Tac Toe, infinite URL todo list, and MySQL projects. Afterwards I created YourWines, then moved onto learning React and NextJS creating Space Meetups and my portfolio sites.
